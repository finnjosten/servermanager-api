## About the Server Manager API
This is the API for the servermanager project. This runs on our VPS/Server of that you want to control. Its mostly designed for Datalix servers but it can be used on any other server that runs linux.

## Security
Although i try to keep things as secure is possible i can not guarentee its fully secure as its i am still starting out with laravel. The project is ran through snyk every so often and any security issues i can fix i will fix.

## Dependancies

```
sudo apt install sysstat
```

`sysstat` is used to for `mpstat` which gives us CPU/Core usage
